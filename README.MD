### Những thay đổi tôi đã thực hiện:
1. Đảm bảo các tiêu đề (`##`) được sử dụng đúng để phân tách các mục chính.
2. Sử dụng dấu ba gạch chéo (```bash```) cho các ví dụ mã lệnh, giúp dễ nhìn và phân biệt với phần văn bản.
3. Đảm bảo có khoảng cách giữa các mục để dễ đọc.

Hy vọng rằng với những thay đổi này, `README.md` của bạn sẽ hiển thị đúng trên GitHub.
